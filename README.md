Overview

You will be creating a "coinage" code module that is capable of calculating the total value of coin objects. After completing the "coinage" code module functionality, you will then update the "server" code file as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify package. The updated "server" file will display an initial web page with web links to to test the "coinage" code. The initial web page will be loaded from a file.

coinCount(...coinage):

Part 5. Create index.html file

Part 6. Initialize project folder as a Node.js folder, and install Fastify

Part 7. Update web server code to import Fastify and fs packages, and coinCount function

Part 8. Add / route with GET verb, and web server listen

Part 9. Add /coin route with GET verb
